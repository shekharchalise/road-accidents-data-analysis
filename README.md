# Road Accidents in US Data Analysis

This project is a basic data analysis and prediction for our Master's Big Data Technology Course

## Requirement
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Server
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Sklearn
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- Geopandas
- Seaborn
- Tabulate
- Descartes
- Statsmodels

## Installation
- We would suggest using `anaconda` to install these packages because some packages like geopandas has lots of dependencies
- We used `Jupyter notebook` to do our code for analysis, so, we would suggest to use the similar packages so that you can see what is happening in each step
